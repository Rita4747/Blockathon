# E-scape: Privacy Tooling Exploration Game (Display Frontend)

This is a display frontend for the E-scape game, an interactive game-based learning experience that engages users through challenges, enhancing the accessibility of privacy toolings.

## Overview

E-scape is designed to educate users about various privacy tools and concepts in blockchain technology through an engaging, escape room-style game interface. This frontend is for display purposes only and does not connect to any backend services.

## Features

- Interactive start screen
- Multiple "rooms" representing different privacy concepts:
  - Zero-Knowledge Chamber
  - Homomorphic Vault
  - TEE Sanctuary
- Cyberpunk-inspired neon design

## Setup

make sure you are in ```/Frontend ```

1. Install dependencies:   ```
   npm install   ```

2. Run the development server:   ```
   npm start   ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Note

This is a display frontend only. It does not connect to any blockchain or backend services. For a fully functional version, additional development would be required to integrate with smart contracts and implement the game logic.

## Future Improvements

- Implement actual puzzles and challenges for each room
- Add a scoring system
- Integrate with blockchain for on-chain interactions
- Expand the number of rooms and privacy concepts covered
